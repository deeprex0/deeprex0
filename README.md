A passionate builder with a soft spot for deep learning, scalable software, and clean code. I enjoy turning ideas into working systems — from research prototypes to production-ready services — and sharing what I learn along the way.

- 🔭 I’m currently exploring: deep learning model efficiency, model interpretability, and tooling for reproducible experiments.
- 🌱 I’m learning: deployment patterns for ML at scale and modern MLOps best practices.
- 👯 I’m open to: collaboration on ML/AI projects, developer tools, and open-source libraries.
- 💬 Ask me about: Python, PyTorch, model optimization, and reproducible research.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love turning long experiments into short insights.

## Featured Projects
> Quick links to projects and experiments I’m proud of. Click through to check code, demos, and notes.

- 🔸 [deeprex0](https://github.com/daibbar/deeprex0) — My profile / experimental sandbox (this repo).  
- 🔸 Project A — A short description of project A (swap this with a real project and a short 1-line summary).
- 🔸 Project B — Another project; explain the problem you solved and the tech used.

(Replace Project A / B with your actual repos or pins — keep 1–3 strong candidates.)

## Tech & Tools
I work across the stack but focus on ML + engineering:

- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash
- ML frameworks: PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- Infra & tooling: Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, experiment tracking
- Data & infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, S3-compatible storage
- Other: Linux, VS Code, testing, documentation
